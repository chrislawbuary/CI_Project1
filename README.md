## Objective

The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS. 
The website is designed to be responsive between different devices and the use of the site to be intuitive by any user.

## Design

### Wireframes

...

### Colour Scheme
A simple dark colour scheme has been used.\
Looking at the overall design of the resaurant interior I felt a dark colour scheme would work best.\
Using these colours it draws the users attention to the large images and focus on the food.

### Typography
![Typography](assets\docs\tyopography-clear.png "Typography")\
I have used two fonts for this website, Amiri and Montserrat.\
I chose Amiri as I felt it worked best with the restaurants exisiting logo.\
And Monsterrat is a very easy to read and clean looking font which I thought suited this website.

### Imagery
The main focus of this website it too show of the food and feel of the restaurant.\
Large scale images were used to catch the users eye immediatly and keep their attention.
