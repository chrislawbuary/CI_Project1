## Objective
In this project I intend the create a website for the restaurant "Porters Steakhouse"
The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS. 
The website is designed to be responsive between different devices and the use of the site to be intuitive by any user.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
A simple dark colour scheme has been used.\
Looking at the overall design of the restaurant interior I felt a dark colour scheme would work best.\
Using these colours, it draws the user’s attention to the large images and focus on the food.

### Typography
![Typography](assets/docs/typography-clear.png "Typography")\
I have used two fonts for this website, Amiri and Montserrat.\
I chose Amiri as I felt it worked best with the restaurants existing logo.\
And Montserrat is a very easy to read and clean looking font which I thought suited this website.

### Imagery
The main focus of this website it too shows of the food and feel of the restaurant.\
Large scale images were used to catch the user’s eye immediately and keep their attention.

#### Gallery
![Gallery](assets/docs/gallery.gif)
- I initially planned for a separate gallery page but when I came across this page [https://css-tricks.com/zooming-images-in-a-grid-layout/] I followed the steps to create my own move over zooming gallery.
- This design taught me how to use custom variables within my CSS.

#### Video and Controls

## Development Issues

When I started to create this website I was initially using GitPod, I came across an issue with the http.server command in the terminal and could not get my live preview to work. After trying to fix this, I could not resolve the issue so moved my development onto Visual Studio Code (windows application). From here I was able to use the extension "Live Server".

As I was now using Visual Studio Code for my development process I wanted to still use GitHub for my commits and push updates.
There is a GitHub extension within Visual Studio Code and I found with an SSH key setup I could use this program the same way as GitPod.

I was using Visual Studio Code for all of my development but when I came back to check my GitHub for updates they had not committed. This was a mistake on my part as I did not check this until afterwards, I was only going off the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

## Testing

For the testing process I ran all my HTML pages through the [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), they all passed with no errors.\

I then moved onto the [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator for CSS, and again this passed with no errors.\
